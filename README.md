# Wireless Communication Using NFR24L01

## Project 1: Send and receive signal using NRF24L01

### Required Component:
  
  #### Hardware:
  2 x Arduino Nano\
  2 x NRF24L01 Module\
  Connecting wires\
  Power Supply
  
  #### Software:
  Arduino IDE
  Putty (to check the data of serial port at COMs)

### Circuit Diagram
Connect all components as given in the circuit diagram of Transmitter and Reciever. (Both the connections are same in look but the coding is different.)

### Process:
  Upload the code of Transmitter and Receiver respectively on Arduino Nano which is given inside the Code folder.
  
  Install the Putty software (Download latest version form - https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html )
  
  Open Putty software and select the Serial menu and enter the COM port number and its baud rate which is declared is arduino code. (You can use Putty software for both ports)
